It contains one spaceship and 6 enemies and a bullet that hits the enemy.
Used three python libraries:
1. pygame(for game interface.)
2. random (it is used so that enemies can regenerate from random position.)
3. math (it is used to calculate the distance of collision and between enemy. By applying distance formula.)

When a bullet hits the enemy you score a point. And when the coordinates of enemy and spaceship equals then the game ends.
